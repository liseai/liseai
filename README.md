# Hi there! 👋🏻 I'm Lidia 💌
### Conversational Designer & Computational Linguist 

## 🌟 What Drives My Work

I don't just build AI agents and chatbots; I fight to craft personalities. I design conversational AI that doesn't just understand what you're saying, but senses and reacts at how you're feeling. Being human means being emotional, and our technology should reflect that statement.

## 📑 What I'm Currently Working On

### 👩🏻‍💻 AI Agents for Customer Service
**Current Role: Conversational Designer & Prompt Engineer at Lovi AI**

I'm designing multichannel AI agents (voice and chat) for customer service and educational enterprises. This is where theory meets practice: How do we automate without becoming cold? How do we solve problems efficiently while making people feel heard, valued, and understood? 

Every day, I work to ensure that these agents don't just process queries — they recognize frustration, offer patience, and leave people feeling better than when they started. Because customer service isn't just about solving problems; it's about honoring the human on the other side of the conversation. It's about giving people a great response on any chanel, at any given time.

**Focus**: Multichannel conversational design • Prompt engineering 

### 📊 Understanding Human Conflict Through Language
**Research Project: Conversational Analysis Tool for Conflict Corpus (Thesis)**

**Goal**: Build a specialized tool to analyze corpus data from conflict conversations between couples and in intimate environments. Using NLP, we'll extract communicative patterns and relational dynamics to understand the emotional architecture of human conflict and connection.

Conflict is one of the most emotionally charged forms of human communication — what we say and how we say it reveals our deepest needs, fears, and patterns. By applying computational methods to this intimate data, I'm exploring how technology can help us understand ourselves better, not replace our capacity for connection.

**Methods**: Corpus linguistics • NLP pattern extraction • Sentiment analysis • Discourse analysis • Data analisys

### 🎮 Exploring Creative Frontiers
**Where AI Meets Artistry**

As a gamer and student of digital literature, I've realized something crucial: our knowledge shouldn't only serve productive tasks—it should fuel creative ones too. Videogames, literature, interactive storytelling—these are where conversational AI can transcend utility and become *art*.

What if NPCs could surprise you? Challenge you emotionally? Remember your choices and grow with you? What if a game conversation could be as memorable as one with a real friend?

This vision drove me to create **Sputnik** for my Master's thesis (detailed below), and it continues to drive my exploration of AI in gaming and interactive narratives. I want to work on any project where AI characters don't just fill space — they engage, feel real, and transform the gaming experience into something genuinely human.

**Passion areas**: 
* Interactive narrative design
* AI NPCs with personality and memory
* Dialogue systems that feel alive
* The intersection of computational linguistics and digital storytelling

## 💻 Featured Projects

### 👾 Creative Conversational Agent for Video Games - Repository Project:

**Master's Thesis - Rasa + LLM**

A goal-oriented conversational agent designed specifically for video game environments. This project combines the robustness of Rasa with the generative capability of large language models to create dynamic, immersive narrative experiences that feel alive.

- **Technologies used**: Rasa, LLM, Python, Goal-oriented dialogue design, Unity (game interface), VRoid (character creation).
- **Philosophy**: Proving that game NPCs can be more than scripted responses—they can be characters that feel real.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

* **NLP toolkit mastery**: Deepening my skills with NLTK, spaCy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for robust linguistic analysis and data processing
* **Transformer fine-tuning**: Working with Hugging Face to fine-tune models for specific conversational contexts and emotional nuance detection
* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Learning to implement RAG architectures to enhance model responses with relevant context and knowledge
* **Data analysis & management**: Using SQL for efficient corpus data handling and analysis
* **Advanced sentiment analysis**: Building models that capture what people actually feel, not just what they say

## 🎓 My Philosophy

I combine computational linguistics with an understanding of what moves people. Every project is guided by one question: Does this preserve our humanity, or diminish it?
My work focuses on:

- ✨ Applying AI creatively to generate conversational experiences that feel genuine
- 🔧 Automating linguistic processes without sacrificing the depth and context of human communication
- 👥 Bringing computational tools to humanistic environments
- 🔍 Making linguistic research more accessible through technology
- ❤️‍🩹 Ensuring that as machines learn to speak, they learn to speak with warmth, passion, and depth
